# Portfolio Project

In this section, I will showcase data analytics projects, briefly outlining the technology stack used to solve each case.

### **Sales Performance and Customer Segmentation Analysis**

**Code:** [Superstore Sales and Customer Segmentation Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/ayadewantis/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/Notebooks/Superstore%20Sales%20and%20Customer%20Segmentation%20Analysis.ipynb)

**Goal:** Identify trends and patterns in sales performance across different segment, categories, and time periods and understand customer purchasing patterns to drive personalized marketing strategies

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of The Superstore dataset. The project involved preparing the data, cleaning it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the relationship between total sales and monthly sales, analyzing the correlation between total sales and total profit for each order, and implemented chi-square coefficient statistical analysis to understand whether the relationship between customer segments and product categories.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** Using Python functions the analysis revealed that votes and budget have the highest correlation with gross earnings, while the company has no significant correlation.
