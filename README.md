# Portfolio Project

In this section, I will showcase data analytics projects, briefly outlining the technology stack used to solve each case.

### **Sales Performance and Customer Segmentation Analysis**

**Code:** [Superstore Sales and Customer Segmentation Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/ayadewantis/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Superstore%20Sales%20and%20Customer%20Segmentation%20Analysis.ipynb)

**Goal:** The objective of this project is to analyze sales performance trends across different segments, categories, and time periods while also identifying customer purchasing patterns. By leveraging data analytics in Python, this project aims to provide valuable insights that support data-driven decision-making, including identifying top-selling products and categories, recognizing seasonal trends and demand forecasting,analyzing revenue breakdown by customer segments, optimizing personalized marketing strategies

**Description:** This analysis is focused on sales data from a superstore, utilizing business intelligence techniques to extract meaningful insights. By exploring customer behaviors, sales trends, and revenue distributions, the project seeks to enhance operational efficiency and strategic planning.

**Skills:** 

📌 Business Intelligence & Data Analytics

📌 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

📌 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

📌 Data Visualization

📌 Python Programming

**Technology:**

✅ pandas → Data manipulation

✅ numpy → Numerical computations

✅ matplotlib, seaborn → Data visualization

✅ scikit-learn → Customer segmentation & clustering

✅ datetime → Time-series analysis

**Results:** The analysis provides key insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and revenue distribution. Some of the major findings include identification of best-selling products and categories, seasonal demand trends that can improve inventory management, revenue distribution across customer segments to enhance marketing strategies, application of customer segmentation for better targeting and personalized promotions

### **Mall Customers Clustering**

**Code:** [Mall Customers Segmentation.ipynb](https://github.com/ayadewantis/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Mall%20Customers%20Clustering.ipynb)

**Goal:** This project aims to perform customer segmentation for a shopping mall using K-Means clustering. The objective is to group customers based on their spending patterns and demographic characteristics, providing insights into consumer behavior.

**Description:** The notebook leverages customer data to conduct unsupervised clustering analysis. By applying K-Means, it identifies distinct customer segments that share similar attributes. This segmentation can help businesses enhance marketing strategies, personalize services, and optimize customer engagement.

**Skills:** 

📌 Machine Learning (K-Means Clustering)

📌 Data Preprocessing & Cleaning

📌 Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

📌 Python Programming (Pandas, NumPy)

**Technology:** 

This project utilizes the following libraries:

✅ pandas → Data manipulation

✅ numpy → Numerical computations

✅ matplotlib, seaborn → Data visualization

✅ scikit-learn (KMeans) → Clustering algorithm

✅ Yellowbrick (KElbowVisualizer) → Optimal cluster selection

**Results:** The analysis successfully segments customers into distinct groups based on their income levels and spending behavior. Using the elbow method (KElbowVisualizer), the optimal number of clusters is determined before applying K-Means clustering. These insights can support targeted marketing efforts, improve customer retention strategies, and enhance decision-making for business growth.
